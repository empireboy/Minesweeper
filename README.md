# Minesweeper

I hope you know Minesweeper! Its an interesting puzzle game. This was an great challenge for me, and it only took me 3 days to remake! I used Flood Flow, an algorithm used for filling a grid.

This is made by me, Casper Meloen from The Netherlands.

# What did I work on?
I used a design pattern called Model-View-Controller.
All the sprites are not made by me.
Flood Fill is an algorithm that I used for filling the grid when you press on an empty tile.
I used the ScriptableObject class for a Minesweeper playground, so you can set the width/height of the minefield and the amount of mines.

# Why and how did I start this project?
This was a project for my study, but I already got ideas what I wanted to work on and what I wanted to learn.
The first thing that came in my mind was a course I did on Udemy about the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
I also wanted to improve on using delegates/events.
On Udemy I also watched another course about a SOLID design and architecture.

# What did I learn?
This was my first project where I used the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
I think I did it pretty good, it was easy for me to change code around and create new inheriting classes.
I also did a good job on using a SOLID design and architecture.
For the first time I used the Flood Fill algorithm.
I got it to work very fast because of my design architecture.

# What if I had more time?
I would make a better UI experience where you can customize the Minesweeper playground.
I would make a winning reward after you found every mine.
I would make a flag counter that counts down on how many flags you have left.
I would make a timer that counts how long you are playing.
